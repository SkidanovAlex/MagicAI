MagicAI
=======

The goal of this project is to write a parser for magic cards to eventually convert them to some sort of generated code, so that one can write game clients that enforce the rules or try to play with different AI algorithms.

Current Status
--------------
The current stage of the project is implementing the parser that can parse magic cards. Currently the status is:

```RTR: all the cards except Tablet of the Guilds
Gatecrash: all the cards except Signal the Clans
DGM: eight cards are missing
M14: five cards are missing
Theros: all the cards except Pyxis of Pandemonium```
