MagicAI
=======

The goal of this project is to write a parser for magic cards to eventually convert them to some sort of generated code, so that one can write game clients that enforce the rules or try to play with different AI algorithms.

Current Status
--------------
The current stage of the project is implementing the parser that can parse magic cards. Currently the status is:

RTR: all the cards

Gatecrash: all the cards

DGM: all the cards except Trait Doctoring

M14: all the cards

Theros: all the cards
